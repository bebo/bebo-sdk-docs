What is Bebo SDK?
--------------------

We’ve been building social apps (Blab and Bebo Messenger) for the last couple years. During that time, we created a platform to help us build these apps. Recently we decided to open up our platform and let anyone build their own group's headquarters. 

Developers use Bebo SDK to build new "rooms" for their own Bebo groups, and the Bebo community as a whole. Anyone with basic HTML+CSS+JS knowledge can make a room, and any Bebo group can install any room.

Open Source and Bebo
-------------------------

**Open Source** is a big part of our philosophy with development on this platform. We want anyone to be able to take what we’ve put together and build their own Rooms

* If you’re a developer, you don’t need backend code. We’ve taken care Database storage, sending real time events, and Real Time Audio/Video Communications.
* Every Room is **open source** (MIT License), if you need an extra feature just fork it and make your changes.
* You don’t need to host your own rooms, **we host rooms for you**.
* If you want you can host your own rooms. It’s just a website; Bebo SDK provides all the functionality you’ll need.
* You have full control of **what** and **who** goes into your private group.

Join the Bebo Developers group on Bebo
---------------------------------------------

The best way to get started is join our Bebo Developers group and introduce yourself.

In Bebo > group list > tap "enter access code" > enter access Code: `wneseg`

We’re just getting started, so expect some dust as we shape this platform. Our team is going to show some examples of what you can do within a Bebo room.
